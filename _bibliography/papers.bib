abstract  ="MXenes are a large and new family of intrinsically magnetic two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal carbides and nitrides. This family has been adding new members since their first discovery in 2011{,} and has expanded with the exploring of ordered double transition-metal (DTM) MXenes. In this study{,} we have investigated the electronic and magnetic properties of thirteen bare and fourteen oxygen-terminated DTM MXene structures (M3C2{,} M3C2O2{,} MM′C2 and MM′C2O2{,} M = Ti{,} Zr{,} Cr{,} and Mo; M′ = Ti{,} V{,} Nb{,} and Ta). The Hubbard-U parameter strongly depends on the atom environment and the coordination number in the cell. Therefore{,} for the first time in the literature{,} we have calculated the Hubbard-U parameters for each considered MXene structure systematically instead of taking them randomly. The investigated MXene structures have striking properties with respect to their magnetic ground states{,} and show ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic or non-magnetic properties{,} accompanied by semiconductor to metallic or semi-metallic properties{,} depending on the transition metal(s) or termination by oxygen. We have performed Monte Carlo simulations to obtain the magnetic phase transition temperature of each structure. Additionally{,} coercivity and remanence values have been calculated for ferromagnetic cases{,} and we have investigated the hysteresis features of the MXenes of interest by applying a cyclic magnetic field at several temperatures."}

abstract = {Ultra-thin forms of black phosphorus (b-P) have been widely investigated due to its unique properties arising from the in-plane anisotropy in its crystal structure. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) forms of black arsenic (b-As) have also been added to the 2D family. In this study, the thickness-dependent structural, electronic, and piezoelectric properties of layered b-As are investigated by means of ab-initio calculations. The structural optimizations confirm the van der Waals type layered structure for both these structures. In addition, increasing the thickness is shown to result in the decreasing of the band gap arising from the confinement of electrons in the layers. In contrast to the case of b-P, it is revealed that a transition from indirect-to-direct band gap behavior can be found in b-As which can be important for optically identifying the single-layer structure. Moreover, the piezoelectric properties are investigated as a function of the number of layers. It is shown that while a single-layer of b-As does not exhibit piezoelectric features, even in the case of bilayer structures the piezoelectricity is created. Our results revealed the strong in-plane anisotropy in piezoelectric coefficients for the three-layer and thicker structures. We have shown that the out-of-plane piezoelectric properties can be achieved by non-centrosymmetric features in the out-of-plane direction in thicker structures of b-As.}

Herein{,} we investigate the dynamically stable single layer forms of XBi (X = Ge{,} Si or Sn) using density functional theory calculations. Phonon band dispersion calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal the dynamical and thermal stability of the considered monolayers. Raman spectra calculations indicate the existence of 5 Raman active phonon modes{,} 3 of which are prominent and can be observed in possible Raman measurements. The electronic band structures of the XBi single layers were investigated with and without the effects of spin–orbit coupling (SOC). Our results show that XBi single layers show semiconducting properties with narrow band gap values without SOC. However{,} only single layer SiBi is an indirect band gap semiconductor{,} while GeBi and SnBi exhibit metallic behaviors when adding spin–orbit coupling effects. In addition{,} the calculated linear elastic parameters indicate the soft nature of the predicted monolayers. Moreover{,} our predictions for the thermoelectric properties of single layer XBi reveal that SiBi is a good thermoelectric material with increasing temperature.

abstract = {Structural, electronic, optic and vibrational properties of Zinc antimonide (ZnSb) monolayers and their functionalized (semi-fluorinated and fully chlorinated) structures are investigated by means of the first-principles calculations. The phonon dispersion curves reveal the presence of imaginary frequencies and thus confirm the dynamical instability of ZnSb monolayer. The calculated electronic band structure corroborates the metallic character with fully-relativistic calculations. Moreover, we analyze the surface functionalization effect on the structural, vibrational, and electronic properties of the pristine ZnSb monolayer. The semi-fluorinated and fully-chlorinated ZnSb monolayers are shown to be dynamically stable in contrast to the ZnSb monolayer. At the same time, semi-fluorination and fully-chlorination of ZnSb monolayer could effectively modulate the metallic electronic properties of pristine ZnSb. In addition, a magnetic metal to a nonmagnetic semiconductor transition with a band gap of 1 eV is achieved via fluorination, whereas a transition to a semiconducting state with 1.4 eV band gap is found via chlorination of the ZnSb monolayer. According to the optical properties analysis, the first absorption peaks of the fluorinated- and chlorinated-ZnSb monolayers along the in-plane polarization are placed in the infrared range of spectrum, while they are in the middle ultraviolet for the out-of-plane polarization. Interestingly, the optically anisotropic behavior of these novel monolayers along the in-plane polarizations is highly desirable for design of polarization-sensitive photodetectors. The results of the calculations clearly proved that the tunable electronic properties of the ZnSb monolayer can be realized by chemical functionalization for application in the next generation nanoelectronic devices.}

Motivated by the successful synthesis of a 2D Pd2Se3 monolayer and the proof of the dynamical stability of Ni2Se3 and Co2Se3 monolayers{,} in terms of the phonon band dispersions{,} we have systemically studied the fundamental physical properties of Janus transition metal chalcogenides{,} such as their structural{,} phonon and thermodynamic stability and their electronic and mechanical properties. Our results show that Janus structures of M4X3Y3 are energetically favorable and dynamically stable. The ab initio molecular dynamic simulations (AIMD) results clearly prove that they kept their thermal stability at room temperature. We have demonstrated their structural{,} electronic and vibrational properties and Raman spectra. The electronic band dispersions show that monolayer Co2Se3 shows half-metal properties with a moderate band gap (1.01 eV){,} Pd2Se3 has a 1.42 eV direct band gap{,} while Ni2Se3 has a 1.38 eV indirect band gap. Pd4Se3S3{,} Pd4Se3Te3 and Pd4S3Te3 are indirect band gap semiconductors with band gaps of 1.22 eV{,} 1.05 eV and 0.61 eV{,} respectively. Ni4Se3S3{,} Ni4Se3Te3 and Ni4S3Te3 are indirect band gap semiconductors with band gaps of 1.61 eV{,} 0.77 eV and 0.49 eV{,} respectively. While pristine Co2Se3 is shown to have half-metallicity (HM){,} the HM behaviour of the Janus Co4Se3Te3 and Co4S3Te3 monolayers disappear and Co4Se3S3 remains a HM with a moderate band gap of 0.85 eV. In addition{,} the Raman spectra of these Janus materials are shown to exhibit totally distinctive features as compared to those of the pristine materials. This work reveals the important material properties of Janus type M4X3Y3 monolayers{,} where M = Pd{,} Co and Ni and X = Se{,} S and Te{,} which could have wide applications in new functional devices."}

The Ti2CO2 monolayer is found to be a semiconductor with a bandgap of 0.35 eV. The introduction of oxygen vacancies tends to increase the bandgap and leads to electronic phase transitions from nonmagnetic semiconductors to half-metals. Moreover, the semiconducting characteristic of O-vacancy Ti2CO2 can be adjusted via electric fields, strain, and F-atom substitution. In particular, an electric field can be used to alter the nonmagnetic semiconductor of O-vacancy Ti2CO2 into a magnetic one or into a half-metal, whereas the electronic phase transition from a semiconductor to metal can be achieved by applying strain and F-atom substitution. The results provide a useful guide for practical applications of O-vacancy Ti2CO2 monolayers in nanoelectronic and spinstronic nanodevices.},

In this manner, two-dimensional transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes) with intrinsic magnetism have attracted significant interest. In this study, we extensively examine the structural and magnetic properties of 1T- and 2H-Ti2C monolayers by using first-principles techniques. We reveal the dynamical stability of both phases by using phonon spectra analysis and abinitio molecular dynamics simulations. The magnetic ground state is determined by considering all possible spin configurations and taking into account spin–orbit coupling effects, strong onsite Coulomb interaction, and corrected self-interaction terms. Our results indicate that while 1T-Ti2C is anti-ferromagnetic, 2H-Ti2C exhibits ferromagnetism, which is stable at/above room temperature. The electronic structure analysis demonstrates that 1T-Ti2C is an indirect bandgap semiconductor and 2H-Ti2C is a half-metal with 100\% spin-polarization. Additionally, it is shown that the magnetic state is robust against low mechanical deformations and fundamental bandgap (also half-metallic bandgap) can be tuned by compressive/tensile strain. Phase-dependent and tunable electronic and magnetic properties of Ti2C monolayers offer new opportunities in the field of low-dimensional magnetism.},

abstract = {In this work, we extensively investigate the structural and electronic properties of van der Waals heterostructures (HTs) constructed by MoS2/BC3, MoS2/C3N, MoS2/, MoS2/ and those using Janus MoSSe instead of MoS2 by performing density functional theory calculations. The electronic band structure calculations and the corresponding partial density of states reveal that the significant changes are driven by a quite strong layer–layer interaction between the constitutive layers. Our results show that although all monolayers are semiconductors as free-standing layers, the MoS2/C3N and MoS2/ bilayer HTs display metallic behavior as a consequence of the transfer of charge carriers between two constituent layers. In addition, it is found that in the MoSSe/C3N bilayer HT, the degree of metallicity is affected by the interface chalcogen atom type when Se atoms face the C3N layer, and the overlap of the bands around the Fermi level is smaller. Moreover, the half-metallic magnetic  is shown to form a magnetic half-metallic trilayer HT with MoS2 independent of the stacking sequence, i.e. whether it is sandwiched or a two  layer encapsulate MoS2 layer. We further analyze the trilayer HTs in which MoS2 is encapsulated by two different monolayers and it is revealed that at least with one magnetic monolayer, it is possible to construct a magnetic trilayer. While the trilayer of /MoS2/BC3 and /MoS2/ exhibit half-metallic characteristics, /MoS2/C3N possesses a magnetic metallic ground state. Overall, our results reveal that holly structures of BCN crystals are suitable for heterostructure formation even over a van der Waals-type interaction, which significantly changes the electronic nature of the constituent layers.}

abstract = {MXenes, transition metal carbides and nitrides, are a bourgeoning class of two-dimensional (2D) materials due to their tunable electronic and magnetic structures, rich surface chemistry and thermal stability. Here, we perform structural, electronic, vibrational and thermal properties of six transition-metal carbides (Re2C, Tc2C, Mo2C, W2C, Os2C, Ru2C) both 2H and 1T phases by first-principle calculations within density functional theory. Although physical and thermal properties of some pristine MXenes put forward to understanding tunable electronic and magnetic properties, many of 1T-phase and almost never of 2H-phase are not investigated in detailed. Firstly, the atomic structure of six MXenes both 1T and 2H phases are optimized, and their respective dynamical stabilities are discussed. Secondly, electronic band structure calculations reveal that the pristine MXenes are metallic. Finally, phonon calculations of pristine MXenes are computed with the density functional perturbation theory and reported. Raman-active modes are predicted and to assign them to specific atomic motions. Ab-initio molecular dynamic simulations (AIMD) are also performed to check the thermal stability of these MXenes. Our results clearly proved that while 2H-W2C, 2H-Mo2C, 2H-Re2C and 1T-W2C can keep the stabilities at very high temperature (1500 K). The results suggest that these pristine MXenes combining with outstanding properties such as non-magnetic metallic state and high-temperature thermal stability would provide promising candidates for using from energy storage to spintronic applications.}

abstract={Two-dimensional materials have the greatest surface to volume ratio and are sought for a number of applications including electrodes in electrochemical storage. Understanding the mobility and chemical exchange characteristics of such layers with ionic charge carriers is vital for electrochemical functionality. Li-decorated b-As has been proposed as a promising material due to fast and directional nature of Li-ion diffusion, making it suitable for use as anode material in Li-ion batteries. Pathways of Li-ion diffusion on such structures is still under debate, and for this purpose, we investigated Li-decorated monolayer and bilayer b-As to shed light on Li mobility, along the armchair and zigzag direction in particular, and estimate the relevant diffusion barriers using DFT. The calculations reveal that (1) functionalization of the surface by Li atoms is energetically favorable, (2) binding of each single Li atom occurs via 2 eV and (3) H site is found the most stable site for adsorption energy of Li-ions. The diffusion barrier of Li-ion on b-As was found to be strongly dependent on anisotropy as the energy barrier along the zigzag direction (0.2 eV) is almost four times lower than the armchair direction (0.8 eV). Moreover, the open-circuit voltage across such a layer decreases with the increase in concentration of Li-ion doping of b-As. OCV is calculated as 4 V for a Li concentration of 20{\%} which is suitable for anode materials. We also discuss some peculiar features of the electronic structure of b-As with Li decoration.},

To represent alloy perovskites, we employ supercells with species A, A’ = Ba, Sr, Pb; B, B’ = Ti, Zr. The effects of composition and atomic configuration/order on lattice structure, thermodynamics, elastic constants and dielectric properties are evaluated. In calculations, we have used linear response and homogeneous field methods and we have also provided an assessment of the performance of these approaches in the determination of aforementioned properties. We have computed dielectric and piezoelectric properties for the cubic form of alloy perovskites. Even though cubic form of alloy perovskites does not have any piezoelectric properties, owing to crystallographic site occupied by different type of atoms, the inversion symmetry breaks down and the structures develop a small tetragonality, in turn a small polarization and non-zero but quite small piezoelectric coefficients emerge as expected. For instance the observed maximum piezoelectric constant for BaZr(1−x)TixO3 is 0.554x10−15C/N. The magnitudes are smaller than the feasible ranges for actual application needs, but they may increase substantially upon phase to lower symmetry tetragonal forms transformation.}
